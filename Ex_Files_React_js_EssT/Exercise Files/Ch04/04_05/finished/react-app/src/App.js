    console.log(`It's ${emotion} around here!`);
  }, [emotion]);// Now, something else to note here is useEffect 
  // actually takes into arguments. The first is this function that's 
  // going to be called whenever we want our effect to happen. 
  // But the second has to do with when the effect is actually 
  // being called. We're going to pass into this an empty array. 
  // If you pass in an empty array, this means that the effect 
  // is not going to be called again after the first render. So, 
  // it's only going to be called once as soon as the component renders, 
  // but not as we change this emotion. We call this array, the dependency 
  // array because we can use it to define when this should be called. Should 
  // it just be called once when our component first renders or another 
  // option is we could pass in a property, a state value, to listen for 
  // any changes in this array. So check this out. If I refresh, 
  // it's happy right now. If I click it again, excited, sad. 
  // Anytime this emotion changes, we're going to see this useEffect fire.


  // So the first thing we want to do, we'll import useEffect from react and 
  // then we're going to use inside of our app component this useEffect hook. 
  // Now this time, instead of setting this equal to some sort of array, 
  // we're going to pass in a function to this. So we'll go ahead and say 
  // console log, it's emotion right now. So now we'll see that this will 
  // log this message to our console. We think about this as being a side 
  // effect. It's not necessarily going to be affected by the render but 
  // instead it's going to be something that just happens alongside the render.

//EXPLANATION FOR STEP 1
// Another important hook that's part of the react library is useEffect. 
// UseEffect is another one of these hooks that is built into react. And 
// this one can feel a little bit tricky because it's typically used to manage 
// side effects that aren't related to a components render. Things like console 
// messages, loading data, and working with animations can often benefit from 
// useEffect. So let's take a basic look at useEffect with a console log. So 
// the first thing we want to do, we'll import useEffect from react and then 
// we're going to use inside of our app component this useEffect hook. Now 
// this time, instead of setting this equal to some sort of array, we're

// just happens alongside the render. 

//ChatGPT Explanation:

// - `useEffect` Hook and Managing Side Effects:
//   - `useEffect` is a built-in hook in React used to manage side effects in components.
//   - Side effects can include actions like console messages, data loading, animations, etc.

// - Basic Usage of `useEffect`:
//   - Import the `useEffect` function from React.
//   - Use the `useEffect` hook inside a functional component.

// - Callback Function:
//   - Inside `useEffect`, pass in a callback function that represents the side effect.
//   - Example: `useEffect(() => { console.log(emotion); });`

// - Side Effects Timing:
//   - Side effects in `useEffect` run after the component's render cycle, allowing for interactions outside the UI rendering process.

// - Example - Console Logging:
//   - In the example, a console log is used as a side effect.
//   - When the component renders, the `useEffect` side effect logs the current value of the `emotion` state.

// - Managing Non-Render Effects:
//   - `useEffect` is ideal for handling non-render-related tasks, such as logging, data fetching, or integrating with external libraries.

// In summary, `useEffect` is a React hook that provides a way to manage side effects that 
// aren't directly tied to rendering. It's used for actions like logging, data 
// fetching, animations, and more. The hook executes the callback function after 
// rendering, making it a powerful tool to handle various tasks that don't need to 
// affect the render directly.


//STEP 2
// function App(){
//   const [emotion, setEmotion] = useState("happy");
//   useEffect(() => {
//     console.log(`It's ${emotion} around here!`);
//   }, []);
  
//   return(
//     <div className="App">
//     <h1>Current emotion is {emotion}</h1>
//     <button onClick={() => setEmotion("sad")}>Sad</button>
//     <button onClick={() => setEmotion("excited")}>Excited</button>
//     </div>
//   );
//  }

// export default App;

//EXPLANTION FOR STEP 2
// Now, something else to note here is useEffect actually takes into arguments. 
// The first is this function that's going to be called whenever we want our effect 
// to happen. But the second has to do with when the effect is actually being called. 
// We're going to pass into this an empty array. If you pass in an empty array, 
// this means that the effect is not going to be called again after the first render. 
// So, it's only going to be called once as soon as the component renders, but not as 
// we change this emotion. We call this array, the dependency array because we can 
// use it to define when this should be called. 

//ChatGPT Explanation:

// - `useEffect` Dependency Array:
//   - The `useEffect` hook takes two arguments: a function and a dependency array.
//   - The function in `useEffect` defines the side effect to occur.
//   - The dependency array controls when the effect is triggered.

// - Empty Dependency Array:
//   - Passing an empty dependency array `[]` means the effect is only triggered once, after the initial render.
//   - It does not depend on any variable or state changes.

// - Dependency Array as Control:
//   - The dependency array is used to specify dependencies that determine when the effect should re-run.
//   - If a variable in the dependency array changes, the effect is re-run.

// - Managing Effect Frequency:
//   - By controlling the dependencies in the array, you can fine-tune when the effect runs.
//   - Useful to prevent unnecessary re-renders and optimize performance.

// - Side Effects with Controlled Triggers:
//   - Using the dependency array allows you to control the frequency and conditions under which a side effect happens.

// In summary, the dependency array in the `useEffect` hook allows you to control when a side 
// effect should be triggered. An empty dependency array ensures the effect runs 
// only once after the initial render. By adding dependencies to the array, you 
// can manage how often the effect occurs based on changes to those dependencies. 
// This helps optimize performance and prevent unnecessary re-renders.

//STEP 3
// function App(){
//   const [emotion, setEmotion] = useState("happy");
//   useEffect(() => {
//     console.log(`It's ${emotion} around here!`);
//   }, [emotion]);
  
//   return(
//     <div className="App">
//     <h1>Current emotion is {emotion}</h1>
//     <button onClick={() => setEmotion("sad")}>Sad</button>
//     <button onClick={() => setEmotion("excited")}>Excited</button>
//     </div>
//   );
//  }

// export default App;
//EXPLANATION FOR STEP 3
// So it's only going to be called once as soon as the component renders, 
// but not as we change this emotion. We call this array, the dependency 
// array because we can use it to define when this should be called. Should 
// it just be called once when our component first renders or another 
// option is we could pass in a property, a state value, to listen for 
// any changes in this array. So check this out. If I refresh, 
// it's happy right now. If I click it again, excited, sad. 
// Anytime this emotion changes, we're going to see this useEffect fire.

//ChatGPT Explanation:

// - `useEffect` with Dependency Array:
//   - The dependency array controls when the `useEffect` hook runs.
//   - It allows you to define the conditions under which the effect should be triggered.
//   - An empty dependency array means the effect runs only once after the initial render.

// - Monitoring Changes with Dependencies:
//   - By adding variables or state values to the dependency array, you can listen for changes in those values.
//   - The effect will run whenever any of the dependencies in the array change.

// - Dynamic Side Effects:
//   - If a dependency value changes, the `useEffect` hook re-runs the specified side effect function.
//   - This dynamic behavior allows you to respond to changes in the component's state or props.

// - Controlling Side Effect Triggers:
//   - Using the dependency array, you can choose whether an effect runs once or responds to changes in specified dependencies.

// - Practical Example:
//   - Demonstrated with changing emotions in the component.
//   - Adding `emotion` to the dependency array makes the effect fire whenever `emotion` changes.
//   - Clicking buttons changes the emotion, triggering the effect accordingly.

// In summary, the dependency array in the `useEffect` hook is used to control when 
// the effect should be triggered. By adding variables or state values to the array, 
// you can make the effect respond to changes in those dependencies, enabling dynamic 
// and controlled side effects.
