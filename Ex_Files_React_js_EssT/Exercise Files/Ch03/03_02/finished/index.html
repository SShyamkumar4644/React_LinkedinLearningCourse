<!--In the previous video we created some components. In this video,
let's take a look at how we can use components to display dynamic data. 
Our restaurant is cool in everything but do you really want to display 
my name? Of course not. No way. You probably want to display your own name. 
So let's go ahead and do that. To start, we're going to pass an object 
called props into our header function. Then before our return statement, 
we're going to console.log(props) 
to see what we get. So if we hit refresh and we open up our console, couple
ways to do that Command + Option + J or Control + Shift + J on the PC, or 
you can right click, 
click inspect and then you'll get to the elements. And then you could go to 
the console. This is going to display an object. Right now this object has nothing in it. 
To add values to this component, we'll need to add them wherever the 
component is being rendered. So right here on line 41 is where we would 
do that. We could say name 
equals and then you can put your own name in here. Let's say your name 
is Cindy. Now, if we refresh, we should see an object with that name. 
Now to access these values 
we would just go ahead and grab them from the props object. So here we 
could use another one of these JSX expressions and we'd say {props.names}'s 
Kitchen. And there we go. 
Cindy's kitchen is now being added.
          <script type="text/babel">
                function Header(props) {
                  return (
                    <header>
                      <h1>{props.name}'s Kitchen</h1>
                    </header>
                  );
                }
              
                function App() {
                  return (
                    <div>
                      <Header name="Cindy" />
                      <Main />
                    </div>
                  );
                }

                ReactDOM.render(
                  <App />,
                  document.getElementById("root")
                );
              </script>-->

<!--So let's go ahead and add a dynamic property to our main component. 
  So the main component also has access to our props object. Right now we 
  are displaying delicious food but we can say {props.adjective} food. And 
  now in the main component we'll say adjective equals amazing. And now this 
  should inject that right into that component. Let's also add a period there. 
  All right, cool. Let's add one more property. And we're going to add that one 
  more property to our new component, which we'll call footer. And the footer 
  component is going to return a footer. So a footer tag. And within that footer 
  tag, we want to use another type here. So we'll say p copyright props.year. 
  Now what we can do if we scroll down a little bit further is we can render our 
  footer inside of our app component. And so far we've just used strings. So far 
  we've used strings as properties. Let's say we wanted to use a number. We would 
  need to wrap this in a set of curly braces. So let's go ahead and refresh that. 
  And we'll see that added here. You also could make this a little more dynamic 
  by adding a function. You could use something like {new Date.getFullYear} and 
  this will just add whatever the current year is. Pretty cool. So we want to 
  think about the props object as being this little container where you can place 
  information in for any component. When we render the component, we'll pass the 
  properties into the component. And then within that component, we'll reference 
  them in the props object with dot notation.
