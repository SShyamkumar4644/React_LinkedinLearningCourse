<!--Now that we have an understanding of how to create elements, we want to create our first component. 
Think of a component like being a little building block. It's a piece of
the user interface that we'll use to describe one part of our application. 
What we can do first is get rid of our emoji helpers here. And then we're 
going to get rid of our unordered list as well. So at this point, we're 
going to create our first 
component as a function. A component is just a JavaScript function that 
returns JSX. So if we added this here, we could say header and then header,
and then inside of our h1, 
we could say Eve's Kitchen. So now once we've created our header, we want 
to render the header using the ReactDOM.render function. Now, with JSX, we 
can, in addition to creating 
these HTML elements, we can also render components. So any time we're creating 
a component, a couple of things to think about. We want to use a capital letter
 and we also want to 
create this as a function. So let's refresh and we should see Eve's Kitchen 
being added to our page. Pretty cool. Now, the next thing we want to do here is let's add another 
component. So we'll say function Main and here we'll return a section and 
another section, and we'll say p We serve the most delicious food around. 
So now that we've created our 
Main component, we can render this one too. So we serve the most delicious 
food around has been added to our page. Now, something else I want to show 
you here is that sometimes we 
want to add a couple different components to the page. It can feel tempting 
to do something like this where we're adding a Header and Main side by side.
And what we'll notice right 
away is that we can't do it. We see an error popping up here. Let's zoom out 
a little bit. We'll see an error right here that says that adjacent JSX 
elements must be wrapped in an 
enclosing tag. React always wants to render a single component. So we could 
wrap this in say a div. Make this the parent of both of the Header and the Main 
and now we can see that 
this has been added. But we also could do something like this. We might want to 
create a function called App and the app is going to be responsible for rendering 
both the Main 
component and the Header. So that's going to look like this. We'll say div, we'll 
close that div. We will add a Header. And we'll add a Main. So instead of rendering 
our div here, 
let's render the App and check it out, we got the same output. Nice, so again, a 
component is just a function that returns some JSX. It returns a bit of our user 
interface and then 
we can use the ReactDOM.render function to render that component using this JSX syntax.

Chatgpt Explained:

- Components: Components are building blocks in a user interface that represent specific parts of an application.
- Creating a Component:
  - A component is a JavaScript function that returns JSX (JavaScript XML).
  - Components are like small reusable units that define a specific part of the user interface.
  - A component can be a function that returns JSX content.

- Removing Emoji Helpers:
  - The previous code included emoji helpers, which are now being removed.

- Creating the First Component:
  - To create a component, start by defining a JavaScript function.
  - The component's name should start with a capital letter and be created as a function.
  - For example, a component named `Header` is defined as a function.

- JSX Inside Components:
  - Inside the component function, JSX can be used to define the structure and content.
  - For instance, within the `Header` component, an `<h1>` element with the text "Eve's Kitchen" is used.

- Rendering Components:
  - To render a component, use the `ReactDOM.render()` function.
  - With JSX, not only HTML elements but also components can be rendered.
  - In this case, the `Header` component is rendered using `ReactDOM.render()`.

- Capitalization and Functions:
  - Components should start with capital letters (e.g., `Header`), while regular HTML elements use lowercase (e.g., `<h1>`).
  - Components are written as JavaScript functions that return JSX content.

- Output:
  - Upon refreshing the page, the component's content ("Eve's Kitchen" in this case) is added to the rendered output.

In summary, components in React are small, reusable building blocks that define specific parts of a user interface. 
They are created as JavaScript functions that return JSX, and they can be rendered using `ReactDOM.render()`. 
Remember to use capital letters for component names and lowercase for regular HTML elements when working with JSX.

EXPLANATION FOR STEP 2

Now, the next thing we want to do here is let's add another component. 

So we'll say function Main and here we'll return a section and another section, and we'll say p We 
serve the most delicious food around. 

So now that we've created our Main component, we can render this one too. 
So we serve the most delicious food around has been added to our page. 

Now, something else I want to show you here is that sometimes we want to 
add a couple different components to the page. 

It can feel tempting to do something like this where we're adding a Header and Main side by side. 

And what we'll notice right away is that we can't do it. We see an error popping up here. 

Let's zoom out a little bit. We'll see an error right here that says that adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing 
tag. React always wants to render a single component. 

So we could wrap this in say a div. Make this the parent of both of the Header and the Main 
and now we can see that this has been added

ChatGPT Explained:

Sure, here's the provided information organized into bullet points:

- Adding Another Component:
  - Introduce a new component named `Main`.
  - Define the `Main` component as a function that returns JSX.
  - Within the `Main` component, use `<section>` tags and a `<p>` element to add content.

- Rendering the `Main` Component:
  - After creating the `Main` component, proceed to render it using `ReactDOM.render()`.

- Displaying Multiple Components:
  - In some cases, it's necessary to display multiple components on the page.
  - However, directly placing components side by side without an enclosing element can cause errors.

- Enclosing JSX Elements:
  - When rendering multiple components or JSX elements, they must be enclosed within a single parent element.
  - React requires that adjacent JSX elements are wrapped in an enclosing tag.

- Handling the Error:
  - If you try to render components directly side by side without a parent element, an error occurs.
  - React expects to render a single component or JSX element.

- Using a Parent Element:
  - To resolve this issue, wrap the components (or JSX elements) that need to be displayed together within a parent element.
  - For example, you can use a `<div>` as a parent element to enclose both the `Header` and `Main` components.

- Displaying Multiple Components:
  - After enclosing the components within a parent element, you can now render them together without errors.
  - The parent element acts as the container for the multiple components.

In summary, when adding multiple components or JSX elements to a page, it's 
important to enclose them within a single parent element. React requires this structure to ensure 
that the components can be rendered correctly. Wrapping components in a parent element prevents 
errors and allows you to display multiple components together.

        document.getElementById("root")

</html>

EXPLNATION FOR STEP 3

React always wants to render a single component. So we could wrap this in say a div. 

Make this the parent of both of the Header and the Main and now we can see that this has been added. 

But we also could do something like this. We might want to create a function called App and the app is going to 
be responsible for rendering both the Main component and the Header. 

So that's going to look like this. We'll say div, we'll close that div. We will add a Header. And we'll add a Main. 

So instead of rendering our div here, let's render the App and check it out, we got the same output. Nice, so 
again, a component is just a function that returns some JSX. 

It returns a bit of our user interface and then we can use the ReactDOM.render function to render that component using this JSX syntax.

ChatGPT Explained:

Certainly, here's the information presented in bullet points:

- React's Single Component Rendering Requirement:
  - React expects to render a single component at a time.

- Enclosing Components in a Parent Element:
  - To render multiple components together, wrap them in a parent element.
  - Use a `<div>` as the parent element to group and enclose components.

- Creating an `App` Component:
  - Consider creating an `App` component responsible for rendering multiple components together.
  - The `App` component can be a function that returns JSX.

- Defining the `App` Component:
  - Define the `App` component using the `div` element as the parent.
  - Inside the `div`, include instances of other components like `Header` and `Main`.

- Rendering the `App` Component:
  - Instead of rendering individual components directly, use `ReactDOM.render()` to render the `App` component.

- Achieving the Same Output:
  - By rendering the `App` component, you achieve the same output as when directly rendering individual components.

- Component Functionality:
  - A component is essentially a function that returns JSX, which represents a portion of the user interface.

- Using `ReactDOM.render()`:
  - `ReactDOM.render()` is used to render a component, whether it's a standalone component or an `App` component that combines others.

In summary, when rendering multiple components together, you can wrap them in a parent element (typically a `<div>`) or create an `App` 
component responsible for rendering a collection of components. The key is to ensure that only one component is directly rendered, and 
that component can encapsulate others. This approach allows you to structure your user interface efficiently and maintain React's 
rendering requirements.
