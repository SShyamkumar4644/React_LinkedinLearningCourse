<!--So, what I want to do is I actually want to create this as a variable heading. So instead of having all of these functions inside of another function,
let's go ahead and cut this whole part here and paste it. And then what we'll do here on line 24 is we'll add heading variable and this should work the same way.
Now let's change this Getting Started with React.
We'll add a couple exclamation marks. Keep us honest to make sure that this is working. And it is. 
So this has allowed us to create a React element using its own separate variable.

ChatGPT Explained:

Certainly, here's the information presented in bullet points:

- Creating a React Element with a Variable:
  - Instead of embedding the `React.createElement()` function directly, it's possible to create a React element using a separate variable.

- Variable `heading` for the React Element:
  - To achieve this, the code section creating the `React.createElement()` function is cut and pasted into a variable called `heading`.

- Using the Variable:
  - The `heading` variable can be used like any other React element.
  - It's placed inside the `react-dom.render()` function to display its content.

- Advantage of Using a Variable:
  - Using a variable for a React element enhances code organization and readability.
  - It separates the element creation from its rendering.

- Changing the Element's Content:
  - With the variable `heading`, the content of the React element can be easily modified.
  - Adding more exclamation marks as a test shows that the content can be updated dynamically.

- Demonstrating a React Element with a Variable:
  - The code's functionality remains the same when using a variable for the React element.
  - This approach helps modularize and manage code more effectively.

In summary, creating a React element with a variable is a way to improve code 
organization and maintainability. By assigning a React element to a 
variable, the element's creation and content can be managed 
separately, resulting in cleaner and more readable code.
