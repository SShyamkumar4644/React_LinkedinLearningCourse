<!--Now, the next thing I'll do is I'll add to this page a script tag,
and we're going to say type text slash JavaScript. And then here I'm going
to type reactDom.render. Now reactDom.render is one of the most important functions
in the react Dom library. It's going to take in two different arguments. The first of the arguments that we'll send to
this function is react.createelement. And we're going to use this to create an
element to add to the page. Instead of using this h1 here I want to create the same
thing using react. So we'll say h1 is the type of element I want to create.
Null is the second  that will pass here because we don't want to pass
any properties to this element. And then finally, we want to mimic this h1 fully
by writing getting started with react, perfect. So now check this out.
This is our first argument that we're going to send. We're going to follow that with a comma and then we'll say document.getElementbyId route.
So to reactDom.render, we're sending two things. The first is the element we want
to create. The second is where we want to put this. So we're saying, take this
element and put it right here inside of this div. So we're going to give that a save. We also need to refresh our page over here,
and we'll notice that we're getting two different outputs here.-->
