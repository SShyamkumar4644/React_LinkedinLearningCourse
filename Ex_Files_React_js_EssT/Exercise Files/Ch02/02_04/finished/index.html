<!--The fastest way to get started with this is to use another one of these CDN 
Links. And I'm going to add this here. If you want to grab the link, you can 
always grab it from the finished file. But we're going to find this at 
unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6/babel.min.js. .min just means that it's 
been minified for the browser so that it will work a little bit more quickly. 
And then the other thing that we need to do, we're still noticing if I refresh this 
that we have that syntax error, the thing we need to do to fix this is instead of 
using text javascript, we need to use text/babel. Babel is going to go through any 
of the script tags that have text Babel and it's going to transform any of these 
tags that don't work in the browser to those create element calls that do. Something
we're seeing here in our console is that it says you're using the in browser Babel 
transformer. Be sure to compile your scripts for production. So this is not the most 
optimized way of working with Babel, but it's going to get us started quickly by 
just using this to transform this in the browser. Later in the course we'll be using
other tools that are going to handle all of this before the code even gets to the 
browser. So that's Babel, in addition to being used for JSX, it's also used for the 
most modern JavaScript syntax so that we don't have to wait to use these awesome 
new features

ChatGPT Explained:

Certainly, here's the information presented in bullet points:

- Using Babel to Handle JSX and Modern JavaScript Syntax:
  - To overcome the limitations of using JSX tags directly and to handle modern JavaScript syntax, Babel can be employed.

- Using Babel CDN Link:
  - The fastest way to get started with Babel is to use a CDN link.
  - The link is `unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6/babel.min.js`.
  - The `.min` indicates that the file has been minified for quicker browser performance.

- Changing `type` Attribute to `text/babel`:
  - To inform Babel to transform the script, change the `type` attribute of the script tag to `text/babel`.
  - Babel will recognize scripts with this type attribute and perform the necessary transformations.

- In-Browser Babel Transformation:
  - When using `text/babel`, Babel will transform the JSX and modern JavaScript syntax within the browser.
  - This approach is convenient for quick experimentation and learning.

- Console Message About Production:
  - A console message might appear mentioning that the in-browser Babel transformer is being used.
  - It advises to compile scripts for production later.
  - This method isn't the most optimized for production but is effective for quick initial usage.

- Babel's Versatility:
  - Babel is not only used for transforming JSX but also for incorporating modern JavaScript features.
  - It enables the use of new language features without waiting for browser support.

- Future Tools for Optimized Usage:
  - As the course progresses, other tools will be introduced that handle transformations before the code reaches the browser.

In summary, incorporating Babel using a CDN link and changing 
the `type` attribute to `text/babel` enables the use of JSX 
and modern JavaScript syntax. This approach allows for quick 
experimentation and learning, although it's not the most 
optimized method for production. Babel's versatility extends 
beyond JSX transformation to encompass modern JavaScript 
features, enabling developers to use the latest language 
capabilities without waiting for browser compatibility.
