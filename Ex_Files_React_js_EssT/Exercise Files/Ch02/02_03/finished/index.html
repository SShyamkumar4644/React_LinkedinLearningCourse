<!--and I'm going to replace the ul here to make this work, 
we're going to just use tags. So this looks a whole lot like 
HTML. We're going to go ahead and create a little emoji list 
here, how about that? So we'll say Control + Command + space. 
We will select a robot. That's one. We'll add another list 
item. Control + Command + space. Cowboy. We'll say moon. How 
about that smiley moon? Perfect. So now we're doing the exact 
same thing that we did here but this time with tags. Now, the 
only problem with this is if I try to run this, we're going 
to see that there's an unexpected token. As soon as we hit 
this line 20 where we're asking React to render a JSX tag, 
we see a problem. In the next video, we're going to fix this 
problem using Babble.

ChatGPT Explained:

Certainly, here's the information presented in bullet points:

- Using JSX Tags:
  - Instead of the `ul` and `li` elements, JSX tags are used to create a list of items.
  - JSX tags resemble HTML, making the code more readable and familiar.

- Creating an Emoji List:
  - An example emoji list is created using JSX tags.
  - The list includes emojis like a robot, cowboy, and smiley moon.

- Unexpected Token Error:
  - Attempting to run the code results in an unexpected token error.
  - The issue arises when React encounters JSX tags like `<ul>` and `<li>`.

- Problem with JSX Tags:
  - JSX tags are not recognized natively by browsers or JavaScript.
  - Directly using JSX tags without any transformation leads to errors.

- Solution Using Babel:
  - In the next video, the problem with JSX tags will be addressed using Babel.
  - Babel is a JavaScript compiler that can transform JSX into compatible JavaScript.

In summary, using JSX tags in code allows for more readable and expressive syntax. 
However, when running the code directly, unexpected token errors occur due to JSX 
not being natively understood by browsers. The upcoming video will cover how to 
address this issue using Babel, a tool that compiles JSX into compatible JavaScript.
